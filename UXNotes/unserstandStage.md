t are the that allows us to better understand users?
* Requirements
* * User Needs Analysis
* * Competitive Analysis
* * Other enquiry and review

#Requiremnets
This is important as users do not think like us. By listening to ideas and understanding what the requirements helps us to understand it better.

###What makes up requiremnets
* Designing interactive experiences
* * Life's Experiences
* * Roles in UXD
* * Today's Multidisciplinary Teams 
###Designing Interactive Experiences
* Defining UXD is the collection of methods that is applied to the process of designing interative experiences and pioritzing the quality of user experience  
* * Optimal Balance is finding a balance for what is good foir the user considering time constraints, budget and other resources. This requires team-effort as having expertise from different area helps to provide a good experience.
* * Challenge the status Quo aims to eliminate designs that does not have good user experience
### Life Experiences 
* We use life experiences to create designs that will fit into people's lives, life experience differs based on the products and design we encounter and we need designers to understand the behaivor of people whom they are designing for.
* <!-- INSET EXAMPLE FROM SLIDES -->
###UXD ROLES WONT BE TESTED!!!

#User needs analysis
There are different types of users such as internal and external users. Internal users are individuals, departments. External users are competitors, supplier, customers and citizens, the context of users differs so different research methods is needed.

#Competitive Analysis (Heuristic Evaluation)
There are four purposes, review a product against conventional designs, obtain feedback quickly, identify potential design flaws and highlight quick fixes. This helps in revamping existing design and understand competition landscape.

##What helps in the analysis?
* Made for humans
*   - Is the site relavent, useful and enjoyable. Does the site match user's mental model, speak in user-friendly language and offers a right level of user control
*   * Is it Forgiving?
*     - Does the site prevent error, is it explained clearly and recoverable with ease. Does the site minimize user mental workload?
  - Is the site catered to visually impared, work with assistive technology and is the text legible?
  - * Self-Edvident 
  -   - Is the site easy to navigate with logical navigation and have icons and graphics that make sense. Does it knows what their target audience is?
  - Is the site consistent in remembering user preferneces and have good default user inputs. Does the site use known conventions.
  - Is the structure, text, image concise? Is it responsive and does it pioritize important tasks?
  - * Trustworthy 
  -   - Is the site up to date, accurate, bug free and keep its promises.
#User Research Methods
* Why is it important?
*   - Users do not think like us, they do not have context of our system
*     - We need to research organizational context to understand what the requirements are to manage expectations, surface the unspoken and understand the stakeholder landscape.
*       - It is the key to successful UXD as we understand the behaiviour, interaction and attitudes in natural setting
* What are the 8 methods of research?
*   - Ethnography methods tries to understand behavior and culture by going out and talking to people wherever they are.
*     - A Day in life is following a persona and observing what they do during the day
*       - Eye Tracking helps to capture user visual attention through unconventional method. This helps to create design that better guide the user attention
*         - Contextual inquiry uses investigator to watch how users interact with the system and discuss what the user saw
*           - Focus Group provide opinions and there are 5 to 12 participants, it will provide variation on themes but has pros and cons and it needs good moderation
*             - Face to face interview is used with wireframe as a question but suffers from artifical, inefficient and biased interview 
*               - Card Sorting helps to provide insights to users mental model and it is a convenient tool for determining the information arhietecture that resonate with the users
*                 - Persona is a fictional character that represent different challenges and is constructed based on research data plus observation. This helps to remind the design team on their end goal.
* What are the 6 challenges to research methods
*   - Research is seen as unglamourous
*     - Designer is referred as an artise trap
*       - Difficult to research on something totally original
*         - Not enough time
*           - Designers cannot visualize research findings
*             - Designers caught in Availability Heuristic, they need concrete data
