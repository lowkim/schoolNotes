# What Design Principles are there?
* Interface Design
* Interaction Design
* Visual Design

## Interface Design
Interface Design is creating virtual space, similar to physical space where the designs need to be planned out, interface is the same. The best interfaces are simple, seamless and invisible to user

### Navigational Design
This is a part of interface design where it is a foothold to web and mobile applications and it guides user when they have the following:
* QN || ANS
* Where am I within the site - Primary Navigation and Secondary Navigation
* Where did I come from - Breadcrumb Navigation
* Where else can I go from here - Contextual Navigation
* How do I find what I want - Search based or faceted navigation

#### Primary/Global Navigation
It provides broad access to the content of the sites and displays 7 categories of content. It is persistent and prevalent across the site. (It shows where u are)

#### Secondary Navigation
It can be either left vertical navigation or horizontal sub navigation and it provide access to deeper lever categories and content

#### Breadcrumb Navigation
There are two types of navigations that are path based and location based. 
* Path based has dynamic links to indicate the user path to current page. INSERT IMAGE 
* Location based has static links to indicate the user location in the site hierarchy. 
This allows user to return to previous pages and is essential for large sites with content hierarchies

#### Contextual Navigation
This is more effective when there is a deeper understanding of users as we can be more effective in displaying contextual navigation to support them.
It is common to cross reference similar items or create shortcut to common links and it supports exploration

#### Search Navigation
It allows users who know what they want to quickly get to the content through the search bar. But it cannot replace browsing based navigation as it supplements it.

#### Faceted Navigation
It encourages users to discover content in multiple dimensions through metadata and is suitable for sites with large number product types.
## Layout elements
* Springboard - Provides overview of app contents and acts as a jumping off point in the app. This is considered personalization.
* List - Acts as a jumping off point into the app similar to springboard and is used for long titles or those that need sub text
* Listing - Supplements creative yet highly effective trends like full screen navigation. It is simple, coherence and has the opposite approach of minimizing space.
* Tabs - It is globally accessible within the app as it is a primary navigation and it is not OS neutral
* Gallery - Browsing based on a gallery of content and works best for frequent uploads
* Slide to reveal list - It is suited for longer list of item as it hides navigation off canvas till the user takes action to expose it. Works well with progressive or closely related pages for example, uber app that allows user to navigate between four different type of services

## Layout Rules
Humans scan instead of reading hence creating a visual a hierarchy helps to amplify important aspects and downsize focus in accordance. People eyes tend to move from:
* Large to small
* Irregular to regular
* Dark to Light
* Saturated to unsaturated

## Interaction Design
* Make it engaging
  * A interface is engaging when it is pleasant and satisfying to use
  * Having a visual, immersive interface will make it engaging as personalization feature, being interactive, style and tone is added.
* Make it memorable
  * Memorability is the measure of how easy it is to use a interface for a returning user. This can be ensured by having standards and consistency. 
  * If an app is used frequently a higher memorability is needed as consistency eases repeated usage.
* Make it error free
  * Provide notification of what went wrong and diagnose what caused the error that will lead to display a precise, clear and constructive error message 
* Make it efficient
  * Enables the user to complete key task ASAP and the application will behave in a consistent and predictable way
    * Such as apple, which recognised the 3 key things user wants to do with a photo
    * Novice will have step by step guides
    * Power user will have shortcuts
* Make it Learnable
  * A interface is learnable through Metaphor, Affordance and progressive disclosure
    * Metaphor is a easy way to convey new concepts using mental mode of similar objects which reduces mental effort and help instinctively tell how a particular object is meant to function
    * Affordance provides a visual perception of an object suggesting how to use it, this will reduces mental effort and the user has to be given visual cues that naturally afford how the object function. Such as a door.
    * Progressive Disclosure gradually display contextually appropiate tools and functionality to reduce complexity. This simplifies the interface as it presents information relavent to the task.
  * If a convention is reinvented, it requires users to unlearn and relearn method leading to more cognitive effort needed.

## Visual Design
* Contrast
* Repetition
* Alignment
* Proximity
* Colors
* Typography
* Space

### Contrast 
It is effective in creating visual interest and is done when two elements are juxtaposed(TypeFace?)

### Repetition
Repetition rewards the pattern seeking brain as it helps to move things from short term to long term memory and it improves recognition and recall hence easing the usage. Some aspects is repeated: Color of button, texture, consistent layout and persistent functions.

### Alignment
Nothing should be placed arbitrarily on a page

### Proximity
The purpose of it is to organize, making items one visual unit when they are in close proximity. Elements that are intellectually connected should be visually connected.

### Colors
* Red - Most simulating color, it catches attention and is a energizing color that symbolize power
* Orange - Used to show cheerfulness and playfulness and is calmer than red plus energizing
* Yellow - The impact varies with vibrancy, usually warming and energetic
  * Bright Yellow is simulating
  * middle shade is welcoming
  * Darker shade give air of antiquity and timeliness
* Green - Bridge between warm and dark color and produce a mix of energy and relaxation
* Light Blue - Friendly and inviting, provides safe and assuring feeling
* Dark Blue - Calming, somber and reliable compared to light blue. It is known for professionalism
* Purple - Sensation of luxury and royalty
  * Light shade elude romance
  * Dark shade represent mysterious
* Black - Strongest of all color, it is used to support other color and create feeling of power and sophistication. 
* White - Give a air of cleanliness, purity and value, it is ideal for supporting role as it draws attention to more simulating elements.
* Gray - Gives an impression of neutrality.

### Combining Colors
* Contrasting colors - they are about 3 steps away from each other, they are used to attract attention or set element apart. For example green contrast yellow, yellow with red.
  * An example would be Glyde website, by alternating background and button color with the same blue and green
* Complementary colors - They are opposite of each other and draw out natural appeal and create more eye-pleasing aesthetic.

### Mixing colors
* Monochromatic - It is basic and uses one dominant color or different shades of the same color by adding white or black. It is common in minimalist design as it naturally empasize the content.
* Analogous - Create more attractive design through relying on colors next to each other
* Complementary - Uses opposite colors to create dynamic and emotionally simulating page
* Triadic - Implemented with three balanced colors joined by a equilateral triangle. It takes no risk to create a visually safe look, however it offers no reward except for security and some diversity 

### Typography
There are 3 Basic Principles:
* Type categories - Serif
* Type family - Bold, italic and other variation
* Letterform shape and stroke

### Types of Typography
* Oversized Lettering
  * The purpose of it is to create a strong first impression, the size is usually bigger than 85 points, the weight is either caps or thick strokes, the proportion and weight is dominant compared to other elements
  * Use it with color, alignment and caps
* Small Typography
  * Used with transparent button, its color, family type and weight is often black with a typeface that is thicker all in caps.
  * Pair it with oversized image and undersized type to create visual intrigue
* Types on Image
  * Integrate Typography with image to create single high impact interface element
  * A concern is contrast and readability, word and image say the same thing so to achieve drama the image needs to be something most people can identify
  * Typography with thick strokes and simple line creates a nice canvass by pairing strong, well placed image
* Simple Typefaces used in interesting ways
  * Typography with thick stroke and simple lines makes a nice canvass through pairing strong, well placed image
* Custom Lettering and Typefaces
  * It add uniqueness to design, the quality is important so use it intentionally and sparingly when creating a logo or branding scheme
  * It add uniqueness to design, quality is key so use it intentionally and sparingly when creating logo or branding scheme
  * It need special work to make it compatible.

### Space
* Amount of elements
  * With lesser element, the more powerful each element becomes. To achieve this, remove interface object until it almost fail then test the design with users
  * E.g. voghi
* Perception Luxury
  * Has a direct relation with the amount of white space.
  - Heavy white space is seen as luxurious
  - Balance white space is seen as affordable but still quality
  - Little white space is seen as cheap and low quality.
