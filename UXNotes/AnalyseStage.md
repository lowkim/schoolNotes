Content Strategy and Content Organisation Techniques

## What is content strategy?
It focuses on planning, creation and delivery of content. So that we can structure our useful and useable content to be easily found, improving the user experience.
There are five strategies:

- Inventory
- Audit
- Templates
- Editorial calendar
- Flow of Content

### Content Inventory
It catalogues the entire content of the website which includes; text,images,documents and application.
We will take stock to find out what content we have, how is it organized, who created it and where is it located at.

### Content Audit
It evaluates the content by assessing its quality and effectiveness that can be broken down into:

- The message of the content
- The accuracy and usefulness
- Is the content written professionally and used by your audience and is it user-friendly

Content audit can provide insights into

- What parts of the site attract and drive users away
- What pages needs to be be consolidated to prevent overlap
- Which part is irrelavent so that it can be removed
- Which content or page engages users the most
- Which pain points that you can fix

The content can be evaluated in three different ways

- What users want
- What contents exist
- What content the clients wants.
